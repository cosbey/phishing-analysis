- **The subject line of the malicious email** (allows the recipients to find the email easier by looking at the subject lines of emails that they have received)
- **Clear instructions on what to do with the email** (this will depend on how the organization deals with phishing emails. This could either be instructing the recipients to delete the email or forward it to a security-owned mailbox)
- **Contact details for if the recipient is unsure what to do** (typically a security-owned mailbox, so the user can get support from the security team)
