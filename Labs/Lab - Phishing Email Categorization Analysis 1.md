## **Lab Overview**

In this activity, we will be evaluating a number of emails to test our skills at analyzing and categorizing suspicious emails. The goal is to just look at the characteristics of each email, and select the category you believe is the most appropriate. Categorizing emails is an important skill, as different types of phishing emails need to be investigated differently.

This is a recon email. The offender is attempting to garner a reaction from the recipient to possibly gather information to determine if the email is still active or not. This situation can possibly escalate into a full blown social engineering attempt to gain additional information from the recipient.



**Question 2 )**

Based off the information presented, our actor is attempting to gain credentials from the recipient. This threat actor uses social engineering tactics of urgency in hopes to persuade the recipient to some type of action.


**Question 3 )**  
What is the category of this email?  
Format: (`Spam`, Recon, Malicious Attachment, Credential Harvester)

The recipient received a spam email. These are typically identified by observing the content which is often advisements or other unwanted email content. It is still wise to handle such emails with care and not to interact with links or attachments.

The sender of this email is also using social engineering methods of urgency to persuade the recipient of interacting with an attachment. This is certainly malicious in it's attempt.

**Synopsis:** It is important to quickly evaluate and categorize the type of phishing email during an incident. This information may be critical during an investigation and determining the root cause analysis as well.
